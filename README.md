This repo produces a daily digest about the Go Programming language. It uses [Matcha](https://github.com/piqoni/matcha) rss generator and Github Pages to host it.  

This is here mainly to be used as a template so you can use it for your own feeds. It also supports password protected pages via [staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt)
